.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.LP 
icpld \-ip <ip> [OPTIONS]

or

icpld \-ip6 <ip> [OPTIONS]

alternatively a mixture of both
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
icpld forks into the background and checks for downtime in a network connection.

You can set it to try against any ip, either on the internet, or on your local
network in different intervals. As from version 0.6.0 icpld also supports IPv6 
addresses.

ICPLD can monitor two connection at once, one IPv4 connection, and an IPv6 one.
You can also limit the use to one connection only, by not specifying an ip.
If you only want to monitor an IPv6 connection, you simply do not specify an 
IPv4 ip. In case you have both an IPv4 and an IPv6 ip specified in the configuration
file, you may override this by specifying the \-4 or the \-6 switch. Giving one of these
tells icpld to \fBonly\fR monitor this. Hence \-6 only monitors an IPv6 connection, even
though there is an IPv4 ip specified in the configuration file.

As the name implies, icpld writes a log as it is running. This logfile is 
by default located in ~/.icpld and is called 'log'. If you want to specify 
another location for your logfile, you can do this by either edit the post
\fBlogFile\fR in the configuration file, or specify one using the \-logfile
option. Normally, when you monitor two connections, they are both logged into 
this default file, but you can however specify a special log file for your IPv6
connection, using the \-logfile6 switch.

See below for more options
.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP 
  Note that some of these options are only available when
  icpld has been compiled with IPv6 support. 
.TP 
.B \-h, \-\-help
Shows the help section and exits
.B \-ip
This switch is required unless there is an 
IPv6 address specified, and decides which ip               
ICPLD will probe for ICMP replies
.TP 
.B \-ip6
This specifies which IPv6 ip icpld will probe
for ICMP replies. This is optional unless the 
\-6 switch is used. Note that the use of one, does
not exclude the other. In other words; you can
monitor both an IPv6 and an IPv4 connection 
with the same icpld process
.TP 
.B \-fbip
Fallback ip. This is the ip ICPLD will double 
check against if the ip specified with \-ip 
is not responding
.TP 
.B \-fbip6
Same as fbip, but for the IPv6 monitoring.
.TP 
.B \-detach
Giving this argument to icpld will daemonize a process that is currently running
in the foreground. Useful if you want to monitor icpld for a while, and then
fork it without having to restart icpld and "pollute" the log files
.TP 
.B \-6
This option will tell icpld to use IPv6 only. Mainly used to ignore IPv4 entries in 
the configuration file
.TP 
.B \-4
This option is used to ignore IPv6 entries in the configuration file
.TP 
.B \-nd
Prevent ICPLD from daemonizing
.TP 
.B \-d
Force ICPLD to damonize (this is default, but can 
be used to override a configuration file setting)
.TP 
.B \-s
Silent. Produces no output what so ever. Has no 
effect in combination  with \-nd (naturally)
.TP 
.B \-m
This option is only useful in combination with \-logfile at which point \-m tells icpld to output
the whole logfile at once, without breaks. Virtually the same as cat ~/.icpld/log
.TP 
.B \-status
Shows the current state of icpld and the connection
.TP 
.B \-log
Displays the performance log 
.TP 
.B \-turn       
Turns the log file over. Old one is saved as ~/.icpld/log.\fBn\fR where \fBn\fR is 
the next available number. A stamp is put in the new log, telling you when it was turned
.TP 
.B \-reset      
Resets ICPLD state and log and quit a current ICPLD process
.TP 
.B \-quit        
Terminates a running ICPLD process. Use this at all times, rather than sending signals manually
.TP 
.B \-interval 
Sets the interval in which ICPLD will check for an 
available connection (default 10 seconds)
.TP 
.B \-dinterval
Sets the interval with which icpld will check for an available connection, once it has been marked 
as unavailable. Will override \-interval in case of downtime. The default is 6 seconds 
.TP 
.B \-pint
Tells icpld how frequent it should send ICMP\-packets once it is in a checking cycle. This
option is equivalent to ping \-i <double> and should not be confused with \fB\-interval\fR
Default is one packet per second
.TP 
.B \-nobeep
Do not generate a beep when the connection comes back up (beeping is only activated when combined 
with the \-nd switch)
.TP 
.B \-logfile
Specifies which logfile to use rather than the default ~/.icpld/log Note that this has an impact 
on \-log as well as \-turn, if you use icpld with different \-log options. A log which is located in 
another place than what \-logfile says, will not be turned.
.TP 
.B \-logfile6
Same as above, but for the IPv6 log. Note that the same file can be used for both connections.
.TP 
.B \-htmlfile
ICPLD can, if you want, duplicate the log file into HTML format. This switch tells ICPLD where 
to put the html output.
.TP 
.B \-htmlfile6
Same as above, but for the duplication of the IPv6 log either specified by \-logfile6 or within
the configuration file
.TP 
.B \-errfile
This option tells icpld where to save the log which contains the output of ping. The output
is only written if the ping failed. This is useful for debugging since you can not only see when
the connection was broken, but also what caused the downtime.
.TP 
.B \-errfile6
Same as the above, but for the IPv6 connection
.TP 
.B \-err
Displays the contents of the errors file (default: ~/.icpld/errors) 
.TP 
.B \-err6
Same as the above, but for the IPv6 errors file
.TP 
.B \-config
Specifies which config file to use. The default is /usr/local/etc/icpld.conf Usage of the config 
file at all is optional as ICPLD can be operated throughoutly by command line as well.
.TP 
.B \-iface
Specifies which source interface or (on some platforms) address to use for the checking
.TP 
.B \-v, \-\-version   
Display version info and exits
.SH "CONFIG FILE"
ICPLD automatically looks for a configuration file in /usr/local/etc/icpld.conf
If none is to be found, it will use the command line
arguments, hence the configuration file is not necessary, but
may be handy and helpful.

The location of the config file may be altered by supplying the
\-config switch at command line.

Note that all command line arguments overrides the values in the configuration file.

Available config options:

.Sp 
.TP 
.B ip
This is the target machine, which we will try to establish 
contact with
.br 
Example: ip=192.168.0.1
.TP 
.B ip6
This is the target machine, which we will check an IPv6 connection against.
.br 
Example: ip6=3ffe::1
.TP 
.B fbip
Fallback ip. ICPLD will double check the 
connection status if the first ip is not 
responding, by probing this ip
Example: ip=192.168.0.2
.TP 
.B fbip6
Same as above, but for the IPv6 connection monitoring
.br 
Example: fbip6=3ffe::2
.TP 
.B interval
Will determine how often we will check for response from the machine specified
with ip. The unit is seconds
.br 
Example: interval=10
.TP 
.B dinterval
Determines how often we will check for an available connection after it has been marked 
as unavailable. The unit is seconds
.br 
Example: dinterval=5
.TP 
.B pint
Tells icpld how frequent it should send ICMP\-packets once it is in a checking cycle. This
option is equivalent to ping \-i <double> and should not be confused with \fB\-interval\fR
Default is one packet per second.
.br 
Example: pint=1.2
.TP 
.B iface
Specifies which interface or (on some platforms) address to use for the checking. This is optional, and if excluded or left blank, the kernel default will be used. This only is useful for determining which trunk is down if you are on a multi\-connected system.
.B logFile
Specifies the location of the log file we will be stamping.
.br 
Example: logFile=~/.icpld/log
.TP 
.B logFile6
Same as above, but for the IPv6 log. Note that 
this option may be set identicaly to \fBlogFile\fR
.br 
Example: logFile6=~/.icpld/log
.TP 
.B htmlFile
Same as \fBlogFile\fR, but the HTML formatted log.
.br 
Example: htmlFile=~/public_html/icpld.html
.TP 
.B htmlFile6
Same as above, but the IPv6 log duplication. Note that this may be set identicaly to the 
\fBhtmlFile\fR option
.br 
Example: htmlFile6=~/public_html/icpld.html
.TP 
.B daemonize
ICPLD will either stay in the foreground, or fork to the background depending on the value of 
daemonize. daemonize is of boolean type, meaning it is either 'true' or 'false'.
.br 
Example: daemonize=false
.TP 
.B nobeep
If ICPLD is active in the foreground, it will generate a beep once the connection is back up 
after downtime. To disable this, set nobeep to true. nobeep is of boolean type, meaning it
is either 'true' or 'false'
.br 
Example: nobeep=true
.TP 
.B cmd4dn
This is a system command which will be executed 
whenever the IPv4 connection drops. This can be 
useful when you wish to be alerted whenever your 
connection goes down.
.TP 
.B cmd4up
Same as above, but when the connection comes back up from downtime
.TP 
.B cmd6dn
This is the same as \fBcmd4dn\fR but for the 
IPv6 connection
.TP 
.B cmd6up
Same as \fBcmd4up\fR but for the IPv6 connection
.TP 
.B errfile
This option tells icpld where to save the log which contains the output of ping. The output
is only written if the ping failed.
.TP 
.B errfile6
Same as the above, but for the IPv6 connection
.TP        
.B Example of a valid and acceptable configuration file
for users which does not have an IPv6 connection to monitor :

# ICPLD config file (/etc/icpld.conf)

ip=192.168.0.1

fbip=192.168.0.2
